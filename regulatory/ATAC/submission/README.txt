This zipped folder should contain:
- epigenomics-master.ipynb
- atac.ipynb
- ATACseqQC.R
- images (folder)

The screenshots and plots generated in the notebook are included in the images folder. Opening a jupyter-notebook server from within this zipped folder should just work fine and the images should load.
