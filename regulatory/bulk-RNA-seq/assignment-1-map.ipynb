It is normal with all Illumina sequencers for the median quality score to start out lower over the first 5-7 bases and to then rise. The blue line is the mean quality score at each base position/window. The per-base quality graph given for each of these runs is very good.\n",

    "This gives a plot of the total number of reads vs the average quality score over full length of that read.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a high-quality run, the distribution of average read quality should be fairly tight in the upper range of the plot, as is the case here.\n",

    "![PSQS](RNA-seq/QC-plots/PSQS.png \"Per-sequence quality scores\") \n",
    "\n",
    "## Per-base sequence content\n",
    "This plot reports the percent of bases called for each of the four nucleotides at each position across all reads in the file. With most RNA-Seq library preparation protocols there is clear non-uniform distribution of bases for the first 10-15 nucleotides. This is normal and expected depending on the type of library kit used. RNA-Seq data showing this non-uniform base composition will always be classified as failed by FastQC for this module even though the sequence is perfectly good, which is the case here.\n",

For example, in RNA sequencing there may be a greater or lesser distribution of mean GC content among transcripts causing the observed plot to be wider or narrower than an idealised normal distribution.\n",

    "Ideally Illumina sequence data should not have any adapter sequence present, however when using long read lengths it is possible that some of the library inserts are shorter than the read length resulting in read-through to the adapter at the 3’ end of the read. This is more likely to occur with RNA-Seq libraries where the distribution of library insert sizes is more varied and likely to include some short inserts. In the QC performed here, no adapters were identified and so no trimming is needed.\n",
